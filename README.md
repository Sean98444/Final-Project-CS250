# Final-Project-CS250
Interpreting user needs uses analysis techniques. This includes gathering feedback,making code modifications and then identifying the specific inputs and outputs for the software. User stories are essential for finding out exactly what the user needs are, what they want to achieve, so the development team understands the requirements. 
I approach developing programs based on the requirements of the project, and the size of it. Using Scrum,prioritizing, collaborating, testing and good communication will be incorporated into my future development work.
Being a good team member means working well with us, not having an "It's not my job" mentality, filling in where needed, collaborating with all team members, takes responsibility, and adheres to coding standards.
